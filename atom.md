# configure (something like) Atom

Atom was a cool text editor but is now [discontinued](https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/) .

If you are looking for something like Atom, check out [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/linux_repositories.html).

If you want IDE + text editor at the same time, check out [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux)
